### Day 5: September 28, 2018

### Day 6: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continue to refactor my code (because there was many errors). I also worked on the first pull request I have received, I read and translate a jQuery code to find his equivalent in vanilla JS.

### Day 7: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: For the first time I contributed to an another repository, I managed to get this app running on Windows and create an another pull request to add a functionnality (Set username when we launch the app)

On gelbooru-client, I discovered the
```js
"oneClick": false,
"allowToChangeInstallationDirectory": true
```
And add it to my app ! Because it's important to have the choice of the installation folder.
Also I fixed [Images are not being retrived](https://github.com/KeziahMoselle/gelbooru-client/issues/22). I learned from that issue because I really need to think more about error handling.

Also I integrate Wakatime tracker on my website ! [keziahmoselle.github.io](https://keziahmoselle.github.io/) the .svg at the bottom ! And struggled to add responsive to it.

### Day 9: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the navigator global and his .onLine property, so I replace the illustration when the navigator.onLine return false !

And I worked on my Discord bot, "gelbooru-bot",I cleaned the code with StandardJS and add a little functionnality : Fetch 5 images with a flag `-5`. I wanted to use RegeX but really struggled to find the right one, so finally I write some sphaghetti code. One of my goal now is to learn how to use RegeX to properly parse user input.
